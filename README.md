# Single Nuclei RNA Sequencing for MND Muscle

Welcome to the single nuclei GitHub repository for [*Impaired signaling for neuromuscular synaptic maintenance is a feature of Motor Neuron Disease*](https://actaneurocomms.biomedcentral.com/articles?query=Impaired+signaling+for+neuromuscular+synaptic+maintenance+is+a+feature+of+Motor+Neuron+Disease&volume=&searchType=&tab=keyword), published in *Acta Neuropathologica Communications*.

To view the analysis visit this website: https://cadaei-yuvxvs.github.io/snRNAseq_muscle_MND/analysis.html

You can find the raw *R* code in the *analysis* folder. 

For the raw single nuclei dataset, please visit our UQ eSpace repository: <https://doi.org/10.48610/0106c8e>.


## About

We characterised the gene expression profiles of muscle cultures derived from two donors with MND and two non-neurodegenerative donors.

See the methods section of [our paper](https://actaneurocomms.biomedcentral.com/articles?query=Impaired+signaling+for+neuromuscular+synaptic+maintenance+is+a+feature+of+Motor+Neuron+Disease&volume=&searchType=&tab=keyword) for details on the isolation of single-nuclei from myotubes for RNA sequencing.
